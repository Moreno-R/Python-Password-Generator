# Python Password Generator🐍
1st Python Project


OVERVIEW:  📖


To prevent sophisticated hackers from accessing your personal accounts, one needs a strong random password generator to keep our accounts safe. 
This code created using Python generates random passwords based on the length, selected by the user. 
By default, this code accepts password lengths greater or equals to 12 characters (>=). 
For a more secure password I used the secrets module because it provides access to the most secure source of randomness that your operating system provides.
