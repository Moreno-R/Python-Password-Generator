# 🐍 Python Password Generator
1st Python Project


OVERVIEW:  📖


To prevent sophisticated hackers from accessing your personal accounts, one needs a strong random password generator to keep our accounts safe. 
This code created using Python generates random passwords based on the length, selected by the user. 
For a more secure password I used the 'secrets' module because it provides access to the most secure source of randomness that your operating system provides.
